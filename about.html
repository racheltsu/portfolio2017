                About Me
            </h2>
            <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Rachel Tsu and I’m a Graphic and Web designer at Southwest Career and Technical Academy. Over the last few years, I have been diligently practicing to improve my skills and better understand art concepts to aid my future career. This portfolio is a compilation of my works that show my learning growth and ability from start to finish. In the Gallery page, you will see samples of my finalized projects as well as descriptions describing the highlight of my assignments as well as what was improved and taken note of. I am looking forward to sharing more of my works, I am also trying to incorporate better concepts and understanding into my art. I am beyond grateful to my teachers who have helped me through the learning process, and I hope that in time, my growth may be admirable and inspirational beyond expectations.

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                Among the many things I’ve learned about art, there are a few key design concepts that continuously inspire me to love and embrace art daily.
                <li> Realism → Realism taught me that there is always room for improvement and how unbelievably child-like my skill still is, but also consistently reminding me that it is achievable.</li>
                <li> Impressionism → Being the very detail-oriented pessimist that I am, this style of art showed me a different and much simpler world that serves as a reminder to appreciate the big picture rather than to fret over every inch of dreadful specifics.</li>
                <li> Expressionism → Uniqueness is indeed something to brag about, which is what makes Expressionism stand out. It tells us that being weird is okay, being different okay, being unique is what makes you special, so embrace it.</li>
                <li> Abstract/Abstraction → One of the first art styles I learned showed me that anything is possible, and the design itself will make sure you remember that.</li>

            <h2>Leonardo da Vinci’s Insight</h2>
            <p>
                “To such an extent does nature delight and abound in variety that among her trees there is not one plant to be found which is exactly like another; and not only among the plants, but among the boughs, the leaves and the fruits, you will not find one which is exactly similar to another.”
