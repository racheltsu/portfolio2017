            <h2>My Vision</h2>
            <p>Amid the sea of thoughts, attempting to command introspection, and unravel an inner incognito suddenly seems like stepping into an unfamiliar and distorted realm. But with our weapon of choice, whether it be a pencil, brush, or mouse, there is a chance to grasp a thin sliver of who we are at heart. The strokes will be my voice when I lose faith in speaking, the art will be my vision for the future when everyone else loses sight of their own dreams. A picture is worth a thousand words, so anticipate Art’s greatest speech.

            <h2>My Will</h2>
            <p>“Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.” Aside from being a well rounded artist, I also aim to achieve being a well rounded person that is reflected through my art, and that the experiences and happiness as well as blood, sweat, and tears threaded into my art will hopefully reach others far enough to send them hope and newfound support.
